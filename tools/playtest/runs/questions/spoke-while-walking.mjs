// Question (#623 S3, speech during activity): an owner asked a walking Soul to say something. Did it speak while the
// walk was still under way, and did that walk go on to complete (speaking did not stop, replace or cancel it)? The say
// and the walk's id come from the seat's own CLI calls; when the walk ended, and how, comes from the world's samples in
// the evidence packs (the seat's own claim never counts).
