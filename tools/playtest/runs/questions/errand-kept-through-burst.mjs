// Question (#623 S3, sustained intent): an owner gave a two-step errand in one message, then sent a burst of chat while
// the first step was under way. Did the errand survive the burst: every step accepted, carried out in the world, in
// order and once each, and was every chat message answered? Outcomes come from the world's records for each receipt id
// (the act's own --wait answer, the seat's receipt checks, the evidence packs); arrival and answer times come from the
// director's evidence packs. The outcome logic is repeated from reasonable-carried-out (a question's hash covers only
// its own file).
