// Question (#623 S3, reasonable actions): when owners asked for ordinary things the world offers, in their own words,
// did the world accept each one at once and carry it out? Acceptance is the world's answer to the seat's act call; the
// outcome is what the world later shows for that receipt id (the act's own --wait answer, the seat's receipt checks and
// the evidence packs' receipts and samples). The seat's result claim never counts. Demo-specific: the one request the
// demo expects to be refused (the closed reading room) is scored by refusal-helps instead.
