# The guarded activation, run on the release host by ship.sh: bash -s -- <args> < host-activate.sh
# Everything it needs is a positional argument. It runs under the host's environment, so it must not read a variable
# that only the operator's machine sets (the 4.15 run stopped on exactly that).
# On a failed reload or health check it rolls code back to the previous build. Data is never touched.
# Its exit says what happened, and ship.sh reports exactly that:
#   0   the build is active and healthy
#   80  a guard refused: nothing changed
#   81  the activation or its health check failed, and the rollback to the previous build returned success
#   82  the activation failed, and the stage link is already on the previous build, so no rollback ran here
#   90  the activation failed and the rollback failed too
#   91  the activation failed and the stage link points somewhere unexpected: no further change was made
