// READ-DISPLACEMENT (continuity C13, 2026-10-31): finishing a `read` walks the reader back to the shelf's browse point. A
// Soul standing idle there was moved by the native make-way courtesy walk (walk.ts makeWay, `<actor>:make-way:<tick>`):
// no decision on its side and no event, and in C13 that walk took it out of the reading room, so the reader's reply was
// heard only by a fixture occupant. A browse walk is `free: 'goal/1'` (engine freeGoalV1): when it begins with another
// body on its goal it ends at a free standing point within 1.5 m in the shelf's own room whose route keeps clear of every
// body near the goal, or it is skipped and the reader browses where it stands. Either way no bystander is moved.
// Deterministic: the reader is put at a fixed point before it asks to read (its 'go' arrival varies with load). A put
// lands "about" its point: relocateHumanV1 refuses a busy body and moves off a point within 0.8 m of another body, so
// every Soul first settles (no programme, no live action), and staging is collision-free by construction: each Soul
// first goes to a holding point outside the library (the arrivals stand inside) chosen more than 1.6 m from every body
// and every final point, then to its final point, which is by then clear of every body. Each put must land exactly (#653). The read takes the
// reading spot nearest the reader; the third case starts west of the midpoint between the two tables' south seats
// (2.61 m from each at x = 74), so it reads by the west shelf by distance, not by an id tie-break.
