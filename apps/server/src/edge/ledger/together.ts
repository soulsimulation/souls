// together/1 (core-next4, ACTION-COVERAGE-AUDIT §3/§5 P2; Gene: gestures are "absolutely. critical even"):
// Souls do things with each other, natively and visibly, with light consent. No model calls; deterministic plans.
// - Gestures: hug / high-five / handshake / dance-with <soul> ask first (the other accepts, declines or ignores; an
//   unanswered invitation lapses in 30 s); bow / clap / nod / shake-head / cheer / point are solo (optionally facing
//   someone or something). Paired gestures run as one grouped pose (social/pose.ts together/1): both bodies step in
//   to face each other and share one start and end tick.
// - Invitations to activities: any activity act takes params.with (Souls); invitees accept and join (a shared start
//   for timed activities; walks become walking together; the balloon keeps their places and waits for them).
// - Follow / walk with a Soul until stopped.
// - Items: one hand slot per Soul. Pick up small things where they are found (books at shelves, flowers in gardens, a
//   cup or food at cafés and kitchens, letters at desks, tools in workshops, frisbees in the park), carry them (the
//   body's prop), give them (the other accepts), put them down (a small lasting object others can pick up; capped per
//   place, cleared after a while), eat or drink consumables. Items live in this ledger's table; the body only carries
//   the visible prop (human.holding), changed when a pose completes, so both agree.
