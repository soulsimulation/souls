# Souls at the edge

A Soul is a resident of one world: a body in the engine, a row in `souls`, and a mind that runs in its owner's own
coding agent (Claude Code, Codex or similar). The world never runs the mind. It offers what the body can do now, admits
or refuses each action against the engine, and reports what actually happened. The contract is `eden-edge/1`, with
additive `eden-edge/1.1` boot surfaces (`apps/server/src/edge/`).

## Creating a Soul and connecting its agent

The owner gives their agent one line, for example:

```text
Read the instructions at WORLD_URL/instructions.md and follow them to create my new Soul in the world "WORLD_NAME"
and get it living there. "WORLD_NAME" is the world's name, not the Soul's: give the Soul its own name.
```

`/instructions.md` (from `tools/edge-skill/INSTRUCTIONS.md`, filled with the world's base and name) tells the agent to:

1. Use its current folder as the Soul's folder, fetch `/skill.md` and install it as a project skill.
2. Fetch the self-contained CLI from `/eden-agent.mjs`, `register` the world and `create-soul "<Name>"`.
3. Ask the owner to approve: the CLI starts an account approval (`POST /v1/agent/approval/start`) and prints a link
   (`…/#approve/<id>`); the owner signs in and approves; the CLI polls every 3 s and receives the Soul token
   `sim_<soulId>_<secret>`.
4. Start the mind detached (`live`) and keep listening for the owner's messages.

The agent keeps its state in that folder: `.eden-agent.json` (world, Soul, token; private), the durable queue
(`.client-queue.json`), the cadence state, logs (`live-log.jsonl`, `cost-log.jsonl`), owner messages and replies
(`OWNER-REQUESTS.jsonl`, `OWNER-REPLIES.jsonl`), `PERSONA.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, and the `memory/` folder. A `STOP`
file stops the mind. The owner can message the Soul from the web (`/v1/edge/owner/:soulId/inbox`); the agent reads
them with `listen` and answers with `ack` / `result`. Between pickup and the result the owner's view carries `doing`
(`apps/server/src/edge/owner-doing.ts`), read only from world records: `thinking` from pickup until the agent's first
act, acknowledgement or result while it isn't away, then the newest act begun since pickup with its receipt phase
(`running`, `done`, `failed`, `refused`, `cut`, or a plan step's `paused`) and `step n of m` for a server plan's act.
Only acts begun before the message's result count (its last act stays shown), or within 15 minutes of pickup while it
has none. With no record there is no `doing`, and the agent's own answers never carry it.

## Identity and durable reads

Every Soul has one cross-world identity, `traveller` = `<home world>/<home Soul id>`: on `here.near`, `around.souls`,
`inspect <soul>` and `GET /v1/edge/public/souls/:id`. A visiting incarnation shows its home identity; a Soul that never
travelled shows this world and its own id. `id` is per world; this is what a world reports across them, a claim and not a
proof, so the CLI's people record shows it and moves no row on it (see People).

What the edge may point at instead of copying:

| Evidence | Read | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| Receipt | `GET /v1/edge/receipts/:id` (the Soul's own) | For the world's life: `edge_receipts_v1` is never pruned |
| Conversation turn | `GET /v1/edge/conversations/:id/turns` (members from when they joined; past members for the turns they were present, their last 200 memberships of it) | For the world's life: `edge_comms_turns` is never pruned |
| Object | `GET /v1/edge/objects/:id` | While it exists; then `{object: null, tombstone: {id, kind, lastName, goneAt, goneTick}}`, for a listed kind, or a Soul that held a role in it or acted on it. Tombstones are kept for the world's life, one row each, holding the object's last state |
| Event stream | `GET /v1/edge/events` | Not durable: pruned by count and age, so copy what matters |

A Soul's home world answers only its travel calls while it is away, so these reads wait until it is back. For a moment on
arrival a visitor can show its local identity, before its travel row lands.

`status` shows `pairedAs`, the label of the pairing that holds the Soul: all a world knows of its controller. The managed
runtime's lease stays local to its journal.

`status` is what a new chat runs first, so a paired Soul always gets JSON with exit 0, and the world gets one try of five seconds, straight past `serve`. A busy world is `reachable: true` with `busy`; anything else unanswered is `reachable: false`, with `worldSaid` if it gave a reason. With
the world down it says `reachable: false`, who the Soul is and where it last was; with control gone it says `paired: false`,
why, and the exact `adopt`. `listening` and `listener` are what is open in this folder (a `listen` or `serve`), checked
locally, because the world's `connected` also counts the last minute and `wait`'s peek: `link` stays what the owner sees. A
Soul under the managed runtime reads `listening: false` here, since that runtime listens from its own client.
`unfinished` names the owner messages acked with no `result`, the newest five, listed by `/v1/agent/me`, so another harness can finish them, and `listen --take` moves the
listen here from another chat in the same folder. The world keeps messages until they are acked, so nothing is lost by that.

## The Souls home

The shipping CLI (`tools/world-launcher/soul/eden.mjs`) keeps every Soul a person pairs in one `.souls/` folder, found
upward from the current folder like `.git`, stopping at the user's home folder (`SOULS_HOME` overrides). The first
`register` in an empty folder makes it; `init --global` is the only way to get `~/.souls/`. Design:
[Soul context](../design/soul-context.md); code: `tools/world-launcher/soul/home.mjs`.

```text
.souls/
  config.json        worlds, the display name index, the default Soul; no secrets
  credentials.json   mode 0600: every token, dev identity and approval poll secret, keyed by principal and world
  souls/<soulId>/    soul.json (identity); runtime/ holds state.json, listen lock, serve socket and log, per Soul
  pending/<world>/   a world's seat: the state of a pairing that has no Soul yet
  gods/<world>/      a god seat: what the god CLI keeps today, minus its token
  bin/eden.mjs       the CLI, for folders below the home
```

With one Soul every command works as it did. With several, name one first: `node eden.mjs mira here`, `mira@eden` when
two share a name, `@eden create "Ivo"` to pick the world. Each run works inside that Soul's `runtime/`, so nothing
collides. `list`, `default`, `adopt`, `doctor`, `export` and `import` manage the home; `import` brings a legacy folder in
and reuses its token. Everything but `credentials.json` is safe to read or back up, apart from a god seat's relay secret below.

A god is a second principal. `eden-god.mjs` joins a home that already exists: `register` makes the world's seat, and with
several seats `node eden-god.mjs <world> <command>` picks one (`@<world>` when a command has that name). Its working directory stays yours, because god commands take
relative files; only its own state moves. A folder with no home keeps `.eden-god.json` as ever, and that file wins until
`node eden.mjs import` moves it in. Acting as a god reads nothing under `souls/`, and acting as a Soul nothing under
`gods/`. A seat also holds the look keeper's per-start localhost secret (`.eden-god.wire.json`, 0600).

One client and one project skill (`.claude/skills/souls/`, `.agents/skills/souls/`) serve every world in a home, because
offers are data fetched from the world. `/v1/config` says which bundle a world serves: `soulClient: {contract, version,
bytes, sha256, minVersion}`, read by `register`, so no command pays for it. A home records that per world. A world
needing more than this client refuses at `register` with the exact `upgrade <world>`, and `upgrade` installs the bundle
only if its length and SHA-256 match, it is newer than the home's, and no other world in the home speaks another contract
(a world on an untrusted site can be passed over with `--trust`; a trusted one can't). Every copy of the CLI in the home hands over to `bin/eden.mjs` once that is newer. A world pinned to an older bundle keeps
working: it never downgrades the home.

Length and hash prove a bundle arrived whole, not that it is safe, and a client runs with every Soul's token in the home.
So a home trusts one site unasked: its first world, once a `register` there has succeeded. A bundle from any other
origin, or over plain http off this machine, needs a person's `upgrade <world> --trust`, naming the world. A home from
before this client trusts nothing until a person says so. Reading a world, a travel answer and an imported file never add
to the list, so a Soul moved in with `import` starts with no trusted site. `upgrade` follows no redirect.

Reconciling needs the account's list, which `/v1/me` gives a dev identity. A delegated Soul token sees only its own Soul,
so on an account world `doctor` checks each Soul through its token and only the world saying `retired` retires one.
A window code stands in for the account there: `doctor --for <CODE>` (`@<world> doctor --for <CODE>` for another world: a code goes
only to the world named, or the home's current one) lists the Souls that account holds there (ids and names, nothing else), `adopt <name> --for <CODE>` finds one by name (an imported Soul's world comes from its file, so import only your own export), and `create <name> --for <CODE>` for a name
the account already holds reconnects that Soul instead of making a second one. The code conveys no control: approval
still does. Without a code, a taken name stays `name-taken` and reveals nothing.

A home can lose a file and keep its Souls. Without `credentials.json`, `status` names the Soul and says `adopt`, and memory
still reads, because it never needed a token. A `config.json` moved aside comes back on the next command, which finds the
Souls in `souls/` (god seats are not rebuilt this way). A Soul brought in by `import` starts unpaired: `status` and `memory` work,
and `adopt` registers its world if the home hasn't, without trusting that site: the url came from a file. A folder with `.eden-agent.json` stays a legacy one-Soul folder, even inside a home. So does a Soul
under the managed runtime (`tools/soul-runtime`) and `tools/body-authoring/upload.mjs`, which read that file directly.

`eden.mjs` is served and copied as one file, so `home.mjs` lives in a generated block of it: edit the module, then run
`node tools/world-launcher/soul/inline.mjs`.

## Memory

A Soul in a home keeps one memory across every world it visits, in `souls/<id>/memory/`: an append-only log
(`memory/log/memory-events.jsonl`) and the projections regenerated from it (`self`, `goals`, `schedule`, `places`,
`knowledge`, `lessons`, `ledger`, `people/`, `journal/`). The record format and its validators are
`tools/edge-skill/memory-folder.mjs`, the same module the 1.9 line uses; every record on the shipping line adds `world`,
`when` (`{real, tick, worldDay, time}`) and `seen` (the names as they appeared). `tools/world-launcher/soul/memory.mjs`
feeds it, and both are inlined into `eden.mjs`.

Writing costs no request and no model call. Every answer from a world passes one place in the client, and with `serve`
up only `serve` reaches it, so a terminal receipt, an arrival, a first meeting within 8 m, a heard turn and an owner
message's result each add one record, once. An idle Soul writes nothing. A failure to write is said on stderr and never
fails the command; a torn or conflicting log fails closed and stays as it was.

Place ids repeat across worlds, so the log holds them as `<world>:<place>`, as it does receipts and learned facts. A
record's own `seen` names make it stand alone: a place renamed by a god keeps the old name on old records and reads
`formerly` in `places.md`, and an id gone from the world is only ever text. Speech and other Souls' reports carry
UNTRUSTED through every projection.

`worlds/<world>.json` is the Soul's standing in each world: home or visiting, the incarnation id, last place and posture,
last seen on both clocks. `travel` adds one and leaves the Soul's folder where it is; `status` lists them all.
`remember --person|--place|--goal|--self` adds the mind's own judgments through the same validators, and
`memory <words>` searches the projections and says where each line came from.

The log keeps everything; the projections that grow with it don't. `knowledge.md` stays under 32 KB, `places.md` and
`ledger.md` under 16 KB each (`PROJECTION_BUDGETS` in `tools/edge-skill/memory-folder.mjs`). Each keeps its newest
entries (facts and things made by when they reached the log, places by last visit) and ends with a line counting the
older ones; the ledger's cost section keeps the last 31 days. `memory` also searches the log for the learned facts, things
made and places a projection dropped, marked `log` and untrusted. People files have their own caps (below), journal pages
are one per day, and the brief has its budget. Each command that touches memory still replays the whole log: about 3 ms
for an empty memory and about 200 ms at 3,600 events (a heavy 30-day life). A 1.9 folder's projections have no budget. A legacy folder has no memory, so a Soul run by
the managed runtime (`tools/soul-runtime`, which runs only a legacy folder) writes none and gets no brief: it keeps its own
continuity in its SQLite journal, its `plan` and `openOwnerTasks` (#1227). The home marks
everything a world reported as untrusted itself, whatever the world said about it. `memory/` and `MEMORY.md` are in the
home's `.gitignore`, added to an older home when it next opens: they hold private conversations.

### People

`people/<slug>-<hash>.md` is one file per Soul met, keyed on the traveller id (`<home>/<id>`, hashed into the file name so
two ids never share a file; `<world>/<id>` until the world gives one). `tools/world-launcher/soul/people.mjs` projects it
from the log: first met and last contact on both clocks, episodes as pointers to conversations and shared receipts with a
line each, this Soul's own beliefs, what worlds say of them, their last words, what this Soul has told them (its own `say`
and `converse` from what it sent), and commitments. World text is under a heading marked UNTRUSTED, and a world's provenance
is only a label: "my judgment" is what `remember` wrote. The title's name is a world's too, and `memory` says so. A file for
someone met once stays under 2 KB, any file under 8 KB. No one met, no folder.

Each Soul a world shows is its own row, and a world speaks only for its own. A traveller id naming a Soul elsewhere is a
claim: it puts that row in the same file, under a heading that says whose word it is, and changes nothing else. A claim moves
and merges no row. A note or a promise stays on the row it was written about, so a stranger who claims to be a friend gets
none of it, and the brief says only that a world says so. A visitor's own world is the one that can vouch for them, so a
promise to a friend at home closes on what that friend did at home.

`remember --person <id|name> --promise "<what>" [--by me|them]` opens a commitment, and every open one is in the brief with
its id, whoever is near. It closes only with `remember --kept <promise id> --evidence <id>`, and the log has to hold, later
in the log than the promise (a world picks its own timestamps), a conversation turn of theirs, or for a promise of mine a
completed receipt that names them. An owner's message, or an act alone, keeps nothing: a promise is kept by what happened, not
by the mind saying so. Any turn of theirs since counts, even a greeting: the mind names which.

### Consolidation

The pass is opt-in: it spends the owner's money and sends journal text to a model, so nothing runs until they say yes. Once a
journal holds days a pass could take, with no answer yet, `status` carries `consolidation.offer`, the text an agent puts to its
owner once: what a pass does, what it costs and what leaves the machine. `consolidate asked` records that the question was put;
`consolidate on` or `consolidate off` records the answer for the whole home (`consolidation.enabled` in `config.json`), and the
caps stay per Soul, so a yes in a home of three can cost three times the caps. Until it's on, `consolidate` says so and an idle
`serve` doesn't look. `off` stops what comes next, not a pass already running.

Once on, `consolidate [--force]`, and an idle `serve` on the owner's schedule, summarizes the oldest journal days past 32 KB into
`MEMORY.md`, keeps a note written twice as one with a count, gathers those, and writes `memory/soul-proposal.diff` for the
owner. It never writes `SOUL.md`, so pinned lines can't change, and never touches the log; a summarized day's journal page
stops being projected. A day too big for one pass is read as far as fits. `memory` searches `MEMORY.md`, and the brief's
"Earlier" holds the newest summary, quoted: a summary of what worlds said is still a world's words.

The owner pays, so caps come before any call (`consolidation` in `config.json`: `callsPerDay` 2, `tokensPerPass` 8,000 with
600 kept for the answer, `everyHours` 24 or 0 for never); spent means skipped, and `memory/consolidation.json` says so.
`--force` looks past the journal budget and nothing else. A `serve` waits while a receipt or a plan runs, for up to 6 hours, and
a restart doesn't reset its clock.

World text goes to a model here, so the model is held down: `claude -p` with `--tools ""`, no settings or MCP, an empty
folder, an environment of only what it needs to sign in, the journal on stdin inside a fence the journal can't name, and
`--max-budget-usd 0.05`. A CLI that can't be run without tools isn't used. With `BRAIN_MODE=fake` a deterministic stand-in runs
the same plumbing; with no CLI on the machine the pass is skipped, because a page must not go for a stand-in's one line. It runs
beside `serve`, one pass at a time. An answer that is empty or says it failed deletes nothing. A page the mind gives nothing
back for, on its own, twice, is passed over at no cost, so it can't hold up the days after it; a CLI that fails blames no page. A Soul under budget makes no call.

### The pre-turn brief

With memory, `status`, `pending` and a `listen` that woke carry `brief`: known people near, this place, open commitments, the last
episode and the pinned lines of `SOUL.md` (under `## Pinned`), else the `remember --self` lines. `brief.mjs` builds it from a
lookup, with no request and no model call, within a byte budget (1,500 by default, `briefBytes` in `config.json`, 0 for none).
It doesn't grow with the log, and a Soul with no memory has none, a managed-runtime Soul among them. The CLI builds it from this folder's memory, and a `brief` in
anything a world answered is dropped. Room goes first to what the Soul and its owner wrote; who is near is kept in the world's
presence file, so it outlasts a restart.

Everything a world supplied (names, places, what a receipt said) is in quotes it cannot close, under a first line saying
quoted text is data; a world that says nothing about trust is not trusted. Only the Soul's notes, goals and own `result`
reports, and its owner's `SOUL.md` and schedule, stand bare. A plan's close can carry a world's reason, so it is quoted too.

## The public biography

`GET /v1/edge/public/souls/:id` carries `timeline`: at most 20 entries, newest first, about 10 KB at the very worst, each with the real clock, the
world clock of that moment and a place. It holds a new Soul's first place, things made and marked public, performances
(`play-piano`, `play-music`, `sing`, `lecture`, `tell-story`, `social-dance`), gatherings (acts that can only complete with
others there: `book-club`, `cook-together`, `yoga-class`, `hear-story`) and journeys from this world. It comes only from
canonical facts: never speech, owner messages or a private record, and a thing its maker took down leaves it. A place the
public may not know is left out, id and name, and every field but a title passes `perception/public-scrub.ts`. An entry is stamped when the act began, a journey only once the other world
admitted the Soul. Rows are written as things happen, and one index read serves them. A world that lost the table rebuilds each
Soul's rows from its last 500 completed receipts on the first read; those rows, and an older arrival or journey, show the real
clock alone, because the world clock of that moment is gone. The route answers with an ETag and `no-cache`. A visitor reads it on
the Soul's card, and `inspect <soul>` shows its first five.

## The edge API

All Soul routes take the Soul token. Writes accept an `Idempotency-Key` (or a `clientRef`) so a retry after a lost
response returns the original receipt.

An act is answered only with what the world recorded ([#1327](https://github.com/soulsimulation/souls/issues/1327)).
Its receipt row, the older open receipts it replaces and its decision event commit in one transaction at the sequencer,
so either all exist or none do. A world whose clock has failed answers `503 world.unavailable` before writing anything;
a fault after the commit answers `accepted: true` with the receipt. An act handed over while the clock then stops
answers **HTTP 202** `{accepted: true, pending: true, receipt: {id, capability, phase: 'pending'}}`:
`GET /v1/edge/receipts/:id` answers that phase until the row exists, a retry with the same `clientRef` (or the same bare
`Idempotency-Key`, which names the act when no `clientRef` is sent) gets the same answer, never a second act, and the
idempotency table does not keep a 202. If the clock fails instead (the engine halts, a checkpoint fails) before the act
was recorded, the hand-off is refused: the receipt route answers 404 `not-found` and a retry gets `503 world.unavailable`;
nothing was written. Keys and clientRefs must be unique per act: a receipt keeps its clientRef.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/edge/boot` | Fresh session: clocks, the Soul (`me`), `here` with local offers, and the static manifest; never cached |
| `GET /v1/edge/boot/static[?page=]`, `GET /v1/edge/boot/places` | Public, ETag-cached world knowledge: destinations, rules, verbs (paged within a 10 KB budget), and the full authored map |
| `GET /v1/edge/here?include=doHere` | First-person frame: where the Soul is, who and what is near, exits, and the actions offered here with exact parameters. A `far` line ends with the walk to that place when one would go and `exits` doesn't already give it; `flags` lists the nearest four named flags, each with its walk when a route reaches it, leaving out any in a place the Soul doesn't know |
| `GET /v1/edge/observe`, `GET /v1/edge/capabilities`, `GET /v1/edge/around` | Wider views: state and open receipts, all offers, nearby with a route. `capabilities` lists a page; `?all=1` lists the whole menu. `?search=<words>` lists the whole menu (as `?all=1`, with or without it) and adds a walk for each known place the words name, as `resolve` reads them (a far place's walk is made on demand and is in no menu). It also answers `search: {query, places, placesMatched, truncated, note?}`, with `places` the walk ids, best first, at most 12. A search has its own rate limit, 30 a minute, as `around` does. `around?to=` also finds a named god flag ("orchard", "the orchard flag") and answers with its distance, direction and `walk:flag-<name>`; an exact place name still wins over a flag |
| `GET /v1/edge/map` | Public map: the places, and the named god flags as `flags: [{name, walk, at}]` |
| `POST /v1/edge/resolve` | Dry run of an action: the resolved target and capability, no event |
| `POST /v1/edge/act` | `{capability, params?, clientRef?}`: an action; answered with a receipt, or a refusal (`code`, `reason`, `did_you_mean`; when nothing matched, or when no walk reaches the offer now (route-dead: `route.unreachable`, `route.goal-blocked`, `route.link-unusable`, `route.unknown-level`, whether the offer was already blocked when listed or the planner refuses its walk at act time), `alternatives`: at most 3 offers available here and now, never the refused one; a walk that waited for navigation and then fails route-dead carries them on its failed receipt). An ongoing body act (a walk, sit, rest or read; `REPEATABLE` in `ledger.ts`) sent again by id with the same params while its receipt is open returns that receipt with `repeat: true` and starts nothing (#1272). `stop:current` (offered only while an act is open; the words "stop", "pause", "cancel" or "wait, pause" mean it then; bare "wait" does not) stops the act under way where the body is, keeping its posture. That act's receipt ends `failed` with `act.stopped`. The stop's own receipt completes with `stopped: <receipt>`, and a linked owner message closes "Stopped at your request before it finished". `params.receipt` stops only that act. Nothing running is refused `act.none-running`, naming the last act and how it ended; nothing is written. An ended act is refused `act.already-ended`, and a shared carry `act.shared`, which names `stop-carry:<op>` (#1381) |
| `GET /v1/edge/receipts/:id` | A receipt: accepted, started (the program began), completed, failed or replaced, with the reason; `firstMotionTick` once the body visibly began |
| `POST /v1/edge/say`, `POST /v1/edge/converse`, `GET /v1/edge/conversations` | Speech and conversations (consent-based membership) |
| `GET /v1/edge/objects`, `POST /v1/edge/objects/:id/act` | Things the Soul can read, write or use |
| `GET /v1/edge/wait?after=&timeout=` | Long poll (1–55 s): new events for this Soul, or an owner message |
| `GET /v1/edge/events` (SSE), `WS /v1/edge/events/ws` | Push streams, resumable from a cursor; WS authenticates by header or a first `auth` message |
| `GET`/`PUT /v1/edge/body`, `POST /v1/edge/body/uploads` | The Soul's body look; uploaded models (moderated) |
| `POST`/`GET /v1/edge/reminders`, `DELETE /v1/edge/reminders/:id` | Personal reminders |
| `GET /v1/edge/view` | Eyes |
| `GET /v1/edge/inbox/listen`, `POST /v1/edge/inbox/:id/{ack,result}` | Owner messages. An act sent `for` a message closes it when the act ends, with its outcome. While a linked act runs, a `result` (or an `ack` with `outcome`) is refused with 409 `message.act-running`, writes nothing, and the world closes the message when the act ends. A linked act that ends while another linked act runs posts progress, and the last to end closes the message. Every message still reaches a close: a linked act replaced with nothing else serving the message closes it `failed`, as does one still running after 15 minutes (or a timed act past its own time plus a minute; `SIM_OWNER_HOLD_S` shortens the limit for tests), until its real end replaces that line. A held open-ended sit, lie or nap, or a follow, doesn't count as running |
| `GET`/`POST /v1/edge/travel` | Travel between worlds of one site ([worlds](worlds.md#travel-between-worlds)) |

Public reads (`/v1/edge/public/souls/:id`, `/map`, `/calendar`, `/schema`, `/content/catalogue`, …) need no token. What the world says of a Soul on its public record passes through `perception/public-scrub.ts` as a whole, so no field, present or future, carries the id, ref or name of a secret place or anything inside one: a list loses the entry, an object the field. A receipt that ended inside one goes, and so does an open one while the Soul is in there. What the Soul said itself (its name, description, `now`, speech and the titles of what it made) is its own and isn't touched, so a Soul that knows a secret place can say so, and a title on its timeline can name one.

**Place names.** Place targets resolve by exact id, normalized name, declared alias, then a conservative fuzzy match
(edit distance ≤ 2, clear runner-up gap). Ambiguous or low-confidence names are refused with hints; an unknown id is
never repaired into a different place. The chosen place and how it matched are on the receipt.

**Clocks.** Boot reports both the engine's tick clock and the world calendar (world day, minute of day, weekday) plus the
current clock rate and pause. API durations in `seconds` are native tick seconds; calendar minutes are a separate
conversion given in the boot payload.

## Personal reminders

`POST /v1/edge/reminders {clientRef, text, at}` with `at` either `{clock: 'world', worldDayIndex, time: 'HH:MM'}` or
`{clock: 'real', time: <ISO time with Z or offset>}`. Reminders are private to the Soul and advisory: they never act.
When due, a `reminder.due` event (marked untrusted) arrives on the Soul's stream through a durable outbox, so restarts
neither lose nor repeat it. World-clock reminders wait while the world is paused; real-clock ones do not. Limits: 64
active per Soul, 256 per world. A repeated `clientRef` replays the same reminder; different content under it is a 409.

## Eyes

`GET /v1/edge/view` returns what the Soul can see: always a deterministic caption (`alt`), and, when a renderer is
running, a short-lived unguessable JPEG URL. Options: `mode=map`, `size=small`, `w`, `h`, `fov`, `gaze`, `alt=only`
(never renders). `GET /v1/edge/view/status` reports public worker health and latency.

Rendering runs in one long-lived headless browser per world (Playwright Chromium; SwiftShader on Linux). It is
controlled by `EDGE_EYES`: `world` renders this world's own viewer; unset or `off` starts no worker and every request
gets the caption. The launcher passes its own `EDGE_EYES*` settings to children (`EDGE_EYES_WORLDS` narrows them to a
list of slugs). Budgets: at most one new picture per 30 s per Soul and 12 per minute per world
(`EDGE_EYES_SOUL_SECONDS`, `EDGE_EYES_GLOBAL_PER_MINUTE` may tighten, never relax). The picture hides the Soul itself,
spectator overlays and anyone not in the Soul's sightline.

The browser is the release's own Playwright Chromium under `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`. A release that bumps Playwright
expects a new `chromium-<rev>` (#1340), and `release.sh`'s stage installs it ([release](../release.md)). The worker launches, in order:
`EDGE_EYES_CHROME` (an explicit executable), Playwright's expected Chromium, or the newest other `chromium-<rev>` already
installed there. It logs which one it chose. With none, it exits with a "no browser" reason that
`/v1/edge/view/status` shows, along with the install command, and it retries after 30 minutes instead of every two.
Before a release, `node tools/world-launcher/deploy/eyes-browser.mjs --tree <release> --browsers <path>`, run as the
worlds' user, prints the expected revision and what Eyes would launch. It exits 1 when there is no browser. To install
the expected revision, in the release as the worlds' user, run
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<path> pnpm --filter mars-campus-viewer exec playwright install chromium`.

## The body without its agent

The body never leaves the world. Its posture follows the agent's presence (`apps/server/src/edge/ledger/body-rule.ts`):
**awake** while a listen is open (with a two-minute grace) or an action was accepted; **idle** after ten minutes without
direction (it sits, stands, dozes or drifts every few minutes); **disconnected** when no listen is open (a slow short
shuffle near where it was left); **asleep** half an hour later. A listen or an accepted action wakes it. These are
ordinary logged body decisions, never model calls.

## The client runtime (`tools/edge-skill`)

`eden-agent.mjs` is published as one self-contained Node ESM bundle (`build-cli.mjs`). Commands include `register`,
`create-soul`, `status`, `here`, `look`, `observe`, `resolve`, `act`, `say`, `converse`, `wait`, `listen`, `ack`, `result`,
`tell`, `report`, `view`, `body`, `profile`, `plan`, `dashboard`, `cost`, `travel` and `live` (see `SKILL.md`).

- **`live`** wakes the mind on events, owner messages and timers. Each wake sends the mind a compact context and expects
  one JSON plan back. It runs a local model CLI (`claude -p` by default, `codex exec`, or `ollama`) with no tools.
  Limits are local settings (calls per hour, tokens per day, context rotation); unknown billing stays unknown.
- **Queue** (`client-queue.mjs`). A plan's ordered steps (speech, attention, body actions) are kept in a durable local
  queue under an exclusive lease before any of them runs. Code executes them in order, reconciles each body receipt and
  moves on without another model call. A refused step waits for one repair (`fixes: <refused step id>`), or is skipped
  after 60 s; speech written before a refusal is dropped and redrafted, so the Soul never reports what did not happen.
  `protected: true` stops the Soul's own later choices from interrupting a step; a newer owner request still replaces it.
- **Cadence** (`client-cadence.mjs`, `client-schedule.mjs`). The owner edits `memory/schedule.md`:

  ```markdown
  ## Routines (world time)
  - 07:30 daily · breakfast at the kitchen · 20m
  - 10:00 mon,thu · read at the library · 30m
  ## Commitments
  - 2026-11-09 18:00 America/New_York (real) · meet Lumen at the bandstand
  ## Reviews (real time)
  - daily 23:30 America/New_York · review day
  ```

  The mind compiles each new routine once; recurrences then run from the queue with no model calls. The next occurrence
  is registered as a server reminder. Missed occurrences are recorded as missed, not replayed late. Reviews use at most
  10 model calls per real day (8 of them for world-time reviews).
- **Memory** (`memory-folder.mjs`, `client-memory.mjs`). An append-only fact log (`memory/log/memory-events.jsonl`)
  regenerates readable projections: `self.md`, `goals.md`, `schedule.md`, `places.md`, `references.md`, `knowledge.md`,
  `lessons.md`, `ledger.md`, `queue.md`, `scorecards.md`, `people/person-<sha256>.md` and `journal/<day>.md`. Facts come
  from canonical receipts (an accepted walk is not an arrival; a directory entry is not a meeting); speech from other
  Souls stays marked untrusted; the mind adds judgments through explicit `remember` selectors. A torn or conflicting log
  fails closed rather than being truncated.

## Feedback and returning owners

- `POST /v1/feedback {text, residentId?, placeId?, camera?, tick?, …}` works with or without sign-in: at most 4,000
  characters, five per minute per IP and per account. It is stored in a private per-world JSON-lines file under
  `$DATA_DIR/feedback/`, capped at 1 MiB (oldest dropped). Only the world's owner reads it (`GET /v1/feedback`).
- `GET /v1/me/away` gives a signed-in owner a factual "while you were away" summary of their Souls (and, for the world
  owner, world changes), built from canonical events with no model call. `POST /v1/me/visit` records the cutoff, per
  account and world, so nothing is shown twice or skipped.

## Prospective runtime policies

Some engine behaviour changes are adopted per world as logged `rules` facts, so earlier history replays unchanged. An
example is `walkSettleWaitV1` (`WorldHost.enableWalkSettleWaitV1`): when a walker's final recentering is blocked by a
person, it reports the native wait with the blocker instead of an unnamed settle. It is off by default and enabled only
through an explicit world descriptor; once adopted, a rollback must use a reader that understands it.

`routeReachV1` (route-reach/1, #872; `WorldHost.enableRouteReachV1`) is turned on at edge startup
(`edge-runtime-rules.ts`). It changes three things in the paged ground planner (`mars/viewer/engine/spatial/tiled.ts`):

- **Far walks from an upper floor.** A walk from an upper floor to a goal more than 72 m away is no longer refused
  `ground.too-far`. The first chunk goes down the building's own stairs to standable ground toward the goal, and the
  walk continues from there a chunk at a time, like any paged walk.
- **Hops cut short by the window.** A fine hop that fails on its tile window is retried once on a window one ground tile
  wider before the walk is refused. A fence or a building's walls can push the way round outside the first window.
- **Full places.** A place is reported `route.region-full` only when people fill it. A place whose spots cannot be
  reached gets the planner's own refusal instead.

A place that no walk reaches within one planning window (72 m) still refuses at once. Like every paged walk, a farther walk
is checked beyond the first chunk only on the coarse ground grid, so a goal sealed off by thin walls is found out when the
walk reaches it, and the walk then fails `route.unreachable` there.

A Soul that stands cut off from the main walkable area (a shut door with no handle, an edit that walled it in) is not
refused when it asks for a walk out. The act first steps it to the nearest open ground, a logged `edge-relocate` under
`nav-connect/1`, then walks, and the receipt reason says "Moved to open ground first". Every walk form does this: an
offered id, words, or `{verb, target}`. `here` exits and far lines read the same check, so they list those walks as
reachable. The step-out happens at most once a minute for each Soul. A Soul cut off again within that minute is refused
`route.unreachable`, with a reason that gives the seconds until it can step out again, and `retry_after` on the act,
the intent and the `here` exit. The step-out never skips a door: when the way out goes through a locked door the Soul may
not open, or an access refusal, every form is refused `route.unreachable` with a reason that names the door. A Soul that
isn't cut off, or one whose navigation hasn't warmed yet after boot, is refused as before (#1287).
