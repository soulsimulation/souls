# Agent lifecycle

Most changes to Soul are made by coding agents, supervised by the maintainer. People follow the same path. The repo's
workflows, templates and skills implement it; this page says what each step means.

```
issue → branch → change + focused tests → proof at the PR's tier → PR → CI + review → merge → release
```

## 1. Issue

Work starts from a GitHub issue: a bug, a feature or a playtest finding. Triage labels it with an area and a proof
tier, tries a reproduction on a fake-mind world, and marks it ready for an agent or for the maintainer's decision.
Plans for individual tasks, briefs and status notes live in the issue and its comments, never in the tree.
Durable product direction belongs in design docs; see [planning and intake](planning.md).

Apply [bounded execution](planning.md#bounded-execution): prefer single-digit-hour slices, finish the authorized
outcome without routine milestone pauses, and get Gene's approval for substantial scope expansion. Use a supported
goal for sustained execution or a durable checkpoint when unavailable; neither changes proof or approval requirements.

## 2. Branch

Claim the issue first (assign it and add `agent:claimed`), then work on one branch, `agent/<issue>-<slug>`, in its
own worktree. Keep the change small enough to review in one sitting; split a large piece of work into issues that each
merge on their own, and put unfinished work behind a flag that defaults to off. How many agents share the repository
without coordinating: [agent workflow](agent-workflow.md).

Keep the agent's context small: read with search and line ranges, run focused commands, and summarise large outputs in
a file under `.local/` instead of pasting them. Start a fresh session rather than letting one grow without bound.

## 3. Change and focused tests

Write the change with its tests. Iterate with `node --test` on the touched files and `tsc -p` of the touched packages
([testing](../testing.md)). Run the walk, bundle or conformance check when your change can affect it. Never run a live
model locally; never point a test at production data.

## 4. Proof

[PROOF-POLICY.yml](PROOF-POLICY.yml) maps changed paths to a tier, and `node tools/proof/tier.mjs` prints yours.

| Tier | Typical change | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| T0 | docs, tools, process, CI | lint |
| T1 | server or package logic, nothing visible | focused tests and typecheck |
| T2 | visible UI or behaviour | T1 plus one uncut, real-speed clip of the changed journey on a fake-mind world (phone too when layout changed) |
| T3 | Soul behaviour, navigation, engines, shared or brittle code | T2 plus a scenario playtest with two repeats per arm, a reviewer agent pass and maintainer sign-off |
| T4 | the release head | the remote gate, live walks, cdn-walk, changelog |

**Proof levels are not equal.** A unit test proves the code does what the test says. A scripted e2e proves a script
can drive the page. Only a walk on the real URL with real input proves a person can do it. Don't call a visible change
done on the first two alone. Report what failed as plainly as what passed, and record a check you could not run as
unverified rather than passing.

## 5. Pull request

The issue's acceptance criteria are written before any code. The PR is the journal entry for the work. Open a draft
from the template:
- **Problem**, linking the issue.
- **Acceptance**: every criterion from the issue, each marked met (with evidence), `unmet:` or `deferred: #n`.
- **Proof**: clips, images and a `proof.json`, uploaded with `node tools/proof/upload.mjs`. Proof never goes in the tree.
- **Self-audit**: commands run and their results, failed attempts kept, a side-effects check (for example, the
  context a Soul sees for absent, distant and nearby objects), known limits.
- **Docs touched**, and the **changelog**.

`node tools/proof/acceptance.mjs check` validates the checklist and `proof.json` locally. The `journal` skill walks an
agent through one milestone; the `epic` skill runs a bounded tranche with review stops only when requested. Add a
fragment in
[`changes/`](../../changes/README.md) for anything users notice, or the `no-changelog` label. A change in behaviour
updates its doc in the same PR.

## 6. Review

CI runs the checks for the PR's paths. The `main` ruleset requires `ci-ok`, the security guards (`gitleaks`,
`path-guard`, `scrub-guard`), `proof-ok` and the changelog `fragment`, and every review thread resolved. PR CI picks
its jobs from the changed paths with the release gate's `--scope auto` map (`.github/scripts/ci-scope.mjs`): server
and package tests, typecheck and the web build, the `apps/web` unit suite (`V4-web`), the `tools/world-launcher` unit
tests (`V3-launcher-unit`) and the `tools/edge-skill` / `tools/client-eval` tests (`V3-client-cli`). Pushes to
`main` and manual runs run every job, which is the evidence the merge train needs for non-strict landing. The browser
walks and the full gate stay with the release. `launcher.test.mjs` takes its 25 ports from
`LAUNCHER_TEST_PORT_BASE=<port>` so it can run beside other local processes; other launcher test files still use their
own fixed ports (`op.test.mjs` takes `OP_TEST_PORT`). Server discovery includes every nested `.test.ts` under
`apps/server/src`; two deterministic shards plus the dedicated latency job cover that inventory exactly once.
The `proof-check` bot keeps one comment
up to date with the tier, the proof that tier needs, and which acceptance boxes have evidence. The `claude-review`
workflow is the default reviewer on every push, including whether the evidence supports each acceptance claim.
An independent provider fallback follows the same [review contract and required checks](agent-workflow.md#review),
with its source, reviewer and findings recorded explicitly. `@claude` answers
follow-ups, and the author answers each comment with a fix or a reason. The maintainer reviews T3 and above and
anything labelled for them. See [review](review.md).

The maintainer gate is part of `proof-ok`: at T3 and T4 it fails until the maintainer approves (or, on their own PR,
adds `approved:maintainer`), so no merge path, the train or `gh pr merge --auto`, lands a gated PR without them
([agent workflow](agent-workflow.md#the-merge-train)). `proof-ok` is skipped on drafts and runs when the PR is marked
ready for review; check a draft locally with `node tools/proof/acceptance.mjs check`.

## 7. Merge

Label the PR `merge:ready`. The merge train merges it: T0–T2 automatically on green (as is when it merges cleanly and
touches no engine or other strict path, otherwise rebased onto `main` and re-checked first), T3–T4 rebased,
re-checked and after the maintainer approves (enforced by `proof-ok`). A conflict it cannot resolve gets
`needs:rebase`. See [the merge train](agent-workflow.md#the-merge-train). `main` is always releasable.

## 8. Release

The release owner, the development coordinator ([release owner](../release.md#release-owner)), qualifies an exact `main` head: the remote gate against the cached baseline, required
approval, staged activation with healthz, walks and cdn-walk, then the changelog and a GitHub Release.
Root-only workflow automation remains under qualification; use the current topology in the release doc. See
[release](../release.md).

## Authority

- Bug fixes need no approval. Neither do test expectation updates, baseline re-pins or skill version bumps that come
  with a reviewed change; record the reason in the commit.
- Destructive production actions (deleting worlds, data, releases or backups) need the maintainer's explicit yes.
- Agents never change permission settings, secrets or other projects' services.
