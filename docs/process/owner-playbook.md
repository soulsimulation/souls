# Running development

Give the development owner the outcome and priority in chat, or open a GitHub issue. You do not need to set up an
agent or choose a branch. The owner finds related work, records acceptance, selects independent tasks and reviews
their integration. [Planning and intake](planning.md) describes the underlying records.

V1 launches work only on an explicit request. Opening an issue or marking it ready starts no worker; there is no
scheduled planner or automatic backlog consumption. CI and required PR checks still run normally.

A launch records **scope, worker ceiling, budget/resource policy, stopping point, and merge/release authority**.
For example: “One worker on issue X; prepare a reviewed PR and stop,” or “One serial lane on navbar issues;
continue between qualified PRs, stop on a product decision, no deployment.” A requested serial lane can work through
its agreed queue without another prompt for each issue. Required proof, review and maintainer decisions still apply.
The owner checks likely collisions at dispatch, when shared contracts change, and at integration; independent work
need not synchronize continuously. Existing workers and jobs reach an explicit handoff before another writer takes over.

Use one [development coordinator](development-coordinator.md) session to manage the agenda. Within an explicitly
authorized agenda it can replace finished workers and select the next ready issue without a new prompt each time.
Tell it priorities, capacity and stop conditions; it persists changes so another session can resume. This does not
require a separate supervisor service, and docs alone cannot supply an unavailable task-launch capability. Your
coordinator stays engaged while the authorized agenda is running, using bounded waits and worker events; you can
plan or ask questions while its lanes continue. Its [private manifest/state](coordinator-memory.md) preserves
preferences, assignments and pending decisions for a fresh session.

The first-session prompt is orientation-only: it reads the rules, current project/release position and existing
activity, gives you a compact report, then waits for your initial agenda and capacity. It does not dispatch workers
or activate a saved agenda until you say to begin. Existing workers and jobs remain undisturbed.

## Requests and priorities

| Say this | What happens |
|---|---|
| “A standing Soul refuses dance here; fix it.” | Find or create a bug issue, reproduce it, define acceptance and claim a bounded fix. |
| “I want reusable custom bodies; plan it first.” | Record the design and unresolved decisions; create concrete next issues without authorizing implementation. |
| “Prioritize the navbar over construction.” | Reorder unclaimed ready work; checkpoint affected active work before moving its owner. Preserve branches and proof. |
| “Take this larger outcome through release.” | Split independently reviewable issues, identify dependencies and carry qualified changes through the release process. |

An issue is a proposal until its outcome, acceptance, dependencies and authority permit work. `agent:ready` is the
dispatch queue; `agent:claimed` means an owner is working on it. Before dispatch, check existing claims and PRs for
shared files, contracts, assumptions, ports and measurement resources. Coupled changes need an agreed interface or
sequential integration. A claim is not a filesystem lock: each writer gets its own branch/worktree.

## Follow progress and review

The [private overview design](../design/project-visibility.md) groups **Now**, **Next**, **Needs you** and **Recently
shipped**. Until its implementation is deployed and access-verified, use the linked GitHub issues, PRs and releases.
An overview is a view of those records, not another place to maintain task state.

A useful checkpoint says what changed, what happens next, its blocker, and an ETA range with an observation time
and assumptions. Unknown is better than an invented date. An unchanged checkpoint does not become fresh when a
collector fetches it again. Ask for the next release ETA separately from completion of the broader roadmap.

Open a PR's acceptance and proof before approving it. Visual journeys need uncut, real-speed footage; still images
do not prove motion. Ask for a correction against a particular criterion or moment in the clip. Failed and missing
checks stay visible. A merge means the code is on main; a release receipt and live verification establish that it
is running. See the [lifecycle](agent-lifecycle.md), [proof policy](PROOF-POLICY.yml) and [review rules](review.md).

## Change the pace

“Use up to four workers on the ready queue” sets a ceiling, not a requirement to fill it. The owner reports actual
active workers and available executor capacity, starts independent work, and keeps shared release/measurement
resources serialized. Count separately owned work, including performance investigations, when judging contention.
Do not silently interrupt another owner to free capacity.

“Reduce to two” stops new dispatch and checkpoints/drains excess workers at safe boundaries. “Pause new work” lets
existing work reach a recoverable checkpoint. “Stop now” interrupts execution, then checks active processes and
leaves exact resume instructions; a production activation still needs a safe recovery decision. None of these
instructions authorizes deleting unfinished work, skipping checks or abandoning an active deployment unsafely.

Run the coordinator on a top frontier model; use workhorse delegates for ordinary implementation and cheaper
delegates for mechanical work with objective checks. Frontier delegates are the exception (roughly 0–5%, a guideline)
for bounded hard planning, cross-stack or mission-critical questions. Report provider usage independently: source, observation time,
quota/reset if available, and unknown fields. Unknown usage is not zero; one provider's meter cannot measure another.
Do not silently switch to paid APIs. Preserve the agreed gate/spend limits and start no scheduled agents.

When a task needs you, the coordinator asks asynchronously with a recommendation and safely parks only the blocked
work. It may refill that capacity from the authorized agenda while you are away. Your reply triggers revalidation
and resumption; silence never grants approval. Updates focus on milestones, releases, meaningful failures and
decisions; task details remain in journals and private state.

## Execute and switch tools

Cloud is the default once a clean task's setup, access and checks have actually worked. Use laptops for needed
native/browser/audio proof or quiet measurements, and Modal for authorized release gates. Follow
[development setup](../development.md) and [focused testing](../testing.md); reuse assets and passing evidence.

Claude and Codex use the same repository instructions and issue/PR records. Before switching, checkpoint the branch,
base/head SHA, durable WIP, met acceptance, failed/unverified checks, proof, active jobs and next command. Keep private
operational details in approved private records. Confirm the outgoing writer stopped; resume existing jobs rather
than rebuilding or restarting a gate because the model changed. See [portable handoffs](planning.md#portable-execution-and-handoff).

### App-coordinated remote execution

An existing subscription-backed worker can use an approved SSH connection to edit and test in a remote checkout;
the model session stays with the app coordinator. This route needs no second remote CLI login and is not an unattended
remote agent or native Codex Cloud dispatch. Use one writer per checkout, reuse the existing checkout, and isolate
test data. Preserve the exact source revision, commands, results and failed attempts for handoff. Return the patch or
commit to the coordinator for publication through configured hooks; never copy credentials or bypass hooks. The
fixture repair in [#609](https://github.com/soulsimulation/souls/issues/609) and [#610](https://github.com/soulsimulation/souls/pull/610)
demonstrates remote implementation and checks with local protected publication.

## Ship and recover

The release owner follows [release and rollback](../release.md), preserving exact-head gate evidence, required
approvals, staged activation and live verification. A ready PR is not deployment permission. Automated release
qualification and the established manual path are distinct: use the documented qualified path while automation
still lacks configuration or receipts. [Operations](../operations.md) and [disaster recovery](../operations/disaster-recovery.md)
cover service recovery; do not expose credentials in issues or ask the owner to paste them into chat.

V1 acceptance is recorded in [#554](https://github.com/soulsimulation/souls/issues/554) and
[#594](https://github.com/soulsimulation/souls/issues/594): usable intake/claims/proof, a real cloud task, a recoverable
executor handoff, concurrent independent tasks, overview access verification, and the actual release path. Mark each
completed, explicitly deferred or blocked with the missing capability. This page alone does not pass those checks.
Full engine extraction, new body features and experience-report collection remain separately tracked outcomes.
