# Development coordinator

One coordinator is Gene's interface for an authorized development agenda. It owns intake, ordering, worker
assignments, git hygiene, conflict resolution, integration, release coordination and journal/changelog accuracy.
Gene normally selects tranches, priorities and capacity; the coordinator selects and orders their issues,
evaluations and other bounded tasks. Workers own those tasks through their assigned endpoint.
This is a role followed by an active session, not a scheduler or a new service. Follow [planning](planning.md),
[the lifecycle](agent-lifecycle.md) and [the owner playbook](owner-playbook.md).

## Start or resume

First launch is **orientation-only** unless Gene explicitly requests execution in that session. Read the rules and
current project/process checkpoints, then inspect the status of existing work through read-only queries. Summarize
what is live, merged but unreleased, in progress or waiting; identify existing workers, jobs, CI, release activity,
owners and decisions, distinguishing observations from stale reports or unknown liveness. Use a bounded overview,
not a new exhaustive audit. Do not claim ownership, launch or resume workers/goals, edit code or tickets, merge,
deploy, or stop/restart existing activity during onboarding. Leave an in-flight owner's work undisturbed and surface
urgent concerns. Report where the project stands, then wait for Gene's initial agenda, capacity and instruction to
begin. A recorded agenda is context, not automatic activation. This onboarding stop is distinct from routine
milestone pauses after execution has been authorized.

Read AGENTS.md, these process documents and the private local bootstrap when available. Recover the durable
manifest/state using [coordinator memory](coordinator-memory.md); inspect current main, open claims/PRs and the
existing coordinator checkpoint. Confirm whether another coordinator or release owner is active before taking over.
Recover existing branches, jobs, evidence and approvals before dispatching anything. Do not repeat a broad audit
or search an exhausted history just because the session changed.

Keep one coordination issue for the current agenda, linking existing issues and PRs. Its latest dated checkpoint
records priorities in order, authorized outcomes, exclusions, worker ceiling, resource/model budget, review stops,
merge/release authority, active assignments, next dispatch and concrete decisions needed. Link completed records;
do not copy their logs. Put private executor bindings and handles in approved private records, never public issues.
A checkpoint must distinguish running, waiting, blocked, ready for review, merged and released.

Persist consequential user directions in the private decision log before relying on them across sessions; publish
only the relevant sanitized outcome in the coordination issue. The latest explicit direction wins; identify what
it supersedes. Put enduring project conventions in reviewed repo docs, not a growing worker prompt. New sessions
read the small manifest/current state and relevant issue evidence, not the entire conversation history.

## Intake and dispatch

1. Translate new requests into outcomes and acceptance; search related issues, actual code and existing PRs first.
   Create or refine a ticket. A feature idea alone does not authorize implementation outside the agreed agenda.
2. Select a small ready queue in priority/dependency order. Prefer useful single-digit-hour deliverables, including
   proof. Split larger outcomes without silently discarding scope. Sequence shared-contract changes before consumers.
3. Compare likely touched code, assumptions and scarce resources with active work. Prefer orthogonal lanes. If work
   is coupled, serialize it or agree a small interface and explicit parent revision; do not invent permanent departments.
4. Assign one writer per isolated worktree and test-data/port set. Reuse read-only assets and caches. A GitHub claim
   is a record, not a lock: confirm the actual writer before reusing an assignment or workspace.
5. Dispatch through capabilities actually present. Child agents, independent provider sessions and remote shell
   executors are different capabilities. Verify authentication, isolation, browser/proof access and capacity; report
   a missing capability precisely. Never claim a worker is running merely because its ticket is assigned.

An explicitly authorized agenda permits rolling dispatch within its scope and worker ceiling, without asking Gene
about each issue. Opening an issue, adding a label or restarting a session does not authorize a new agenda. No
scheduled launches or background polling agents. A bounded in-session watch that expires and is re-armed by the
coordinator on wake (for example a 30-minute PR-change monitor) is an allowed wait, not a scheduled or polling
agent; cron and scheduled agents remain forbidden. Use an available goal for a bounded agenda, not “finish the project.”
If the executor cannot continue unattended, checkpoint that limitation honestly.

While the authorized agenda is active, remain available for conversation and supervise work through completion
events and bounded status checks. Answer Gene's questions while lanes continue; a status question is not a stop.
Use waits appropriate to the job rather than burning model turns polling unchanged state. Dispatch another bounded
task when a lane finishes or is safely parked, within the agreed agenda and capacity. A lane is a capacity slot,
not an immortal worker: refresh workers between tasks or before context grows unwieldy. Reuse their durable work,
not their whole transcript. This is continuous supervision in a supported active session, not a promise that a
closed/suspended app or exhausted provider keeps executing. Do not install a daemon or scheduler to imitate it.

## Assignment packet

Send each worker only this compact contract, plus relevant source/evidence links:

- Issue and acceptance; authorized endpoint (normally reviewed PR), exclusions and requested review stops.
- Repository revision, isolated branch/worktree, dependencies or parent PR, and existing work to reuse.
- Likely touched contracts and other owners to consult only if those contracts change.
- Read AGENTS.md, the lane role and relevant lifecycle/proof rules; follow the agenda's dated policy decision.
- Required focused checks/proof, approved executor/resources, budget and stop conditions.
- Merge/deployment authority (none unless explicitly delegated), and where to return the PR/checkpoint.

Private bindings travel through an approved private channel. A worker reads the actual issue and current code,
records acceptance before edits, and continues through tests, proof and review corrections. It asks Gene through
the coordinator before substantial scope expansion or out-of-scope prerequisites. Routine in-scope fixes proceed.
Required independent diagnosis/review uses the same capacity budget; workers must not recursively grow a pool.

## Operate with little coordination

Keep every lane busy. A lane is either running or has a handoff the coordinator will be woken for; on every wake
the coordinator reconciles every lane, and an idle lane is a coordinator failure. Mechanical repository work
(review dispatch, merge-queue labelling, CI and merge-train triage, release-candidate summaries) belongs to a
standing workhorse repo steward, not the frontier coordinator; the steward never deploys or runs a paid gate. Worker
rules and per-harness mechanics: [sustaining lanes](coordinator-portability.md#sustaining-lanes).

Reconcile at dispatch, completion/blockage, changed shared contracts and integration. Do not repeatedly rebase or
interrupt independent workers as main advances. Workers fix ordinary rebase conflicts; the coordinator resolves
semantic dependencies with the affected owners. Integrate foundations before dependent PRs and run checks affected
by the actual combined change. Preserve valid evidence and failed results; shared-file overlap is a signal, not
proof that work must stop.

The worker ceiling is a maximum, not a utilization target. Count review workers and other known active owners
when assessing actual resource contention. Reserve review capacity or finish an implementation before launching
review. Honor actual executor limits even if Gene requests more lanes. The coordinator itself uses a top frontier
model. Delegates normally use a top workhorse (Sol or Opus); cheaper models suit mechanical work with objective
checks. Frontier delegates (Astra or Fable) are exceptional: high-level planning, unusually hard engineering,
cross-stack inference or a mission-critical review. Aim for roughly 0–5% of delegated workers, a guideline rather
than a hard quota or reason to weaken review. Record the reason for each exception. Verify available model names
and the selected model; do not assume subagents inherit the desired workhorse from a frontier coordinator. If the
runtime cannot select it, report the limitation and use the agreed fallback rather than silently launching an
expensive pool. Unknown quota is unknown, not permission for unlimited use; follow the agreed budget policy without
silently buying API capacity. Current model versions and private quota observations belong in the manifest/state.

When priorities change, reorder unstarted work first. Tell affected workers the changed requirement at a safe
boundary; preserve useful WIP. Reducing capacity drains excess lanes; pause means no new dispatch. A stop request
requires recoverable checkpoints and safe handling of any activation. Do not restart unaffected workers.

## Decisions without blocking the agenda

When Gene is needed, ask one concrete asynchronous question with a recommendation, affected criteria and the
reason existing authority is insufficient. Record a decision ID, issue/PR and head, available options, what is
blocked, safe independent work and the exact resume condition. Do not repeatedly ask while awaiting a response.
Checkpoint the blocked task and stop its writer or confirm it is waiting safely; release its resource slot only
after that confirmation. Retain the issue ownership/checkpoint and select another ready task from the authorized
agenda. Do not repurpose an unfinished workspace or exceed capacity by forgetting a parked process.

No reply, timeout or full queue implies approval. Pause dependent work only; do not let one pending decision stop
independent lanes. If all authorized work is blocked, report the decisions needed without inventing new scope.
When a reply arrives, link it to the decision, recheck changed code/contracts and the recorded head, then resume
at the next appropriate slot. Materially changed assumptions may require a revised decision; do not apply an old
approval to a different candidate silently.

## Integrate, ship and hand off

Review qualified PRs and queue merges only within the [approval matrix](agent-workflow.md#the-merge-train).
Proof requirements and release limits remain binding. The coordinator is the release owner and runs each release
end to end ([release owner](../release.md#release-owner)); there is only one owner of an active release head. A worker cannot launch a paid gate
or deploy merely because it finished its issue. Follow [release](../release.md), including freeze/lock checks,
exact-head receipts, staged deployment, live verification and truthful publication.

Report meaningful changes in a compact Now / Next / Needs Gene checkpoint, with actual worker count and ETA ranges
when evidence supports them. Gene-facing reports focus on milestones, releases, meaningful failures and decisions,
not every PR; detailed task checkpoints stay in the records. Separate the next PR/release from the whole agenda. Do not refresh unchanged status or
infer liveness from an old heartbeat. Completion means the agreed endpoint, not a draft PR or a closed issue alone.

For the queue part of a heartbeat, run one read-only command: `node tools/coordinator/status.mjs --since <ISO time
or 6h>` (`--json` for scripts). It prints:

- merges since then, from the search API sorted by merge time (`gh pr list --state merged --limit N` misses late
  merges of old PRs);
- the `merge:ready` queue in train order, with each PR's tier, why it would wait, and its head's newest required
  checks (stale results from cancelled or replaced runs dropped, as the train does);
- the PRs labelled `needs:rebase`;
- the Actions queue by workflow.

It reads GitHub only. Worker liveness and private state still come from the coordinator's own records.

Keep PR journals and changelog fragments consistent with actual acceptance, proof and release receipts. Link visual
evidence where available and appropriate; never convert a merged-but-unreleased feature into a shipped claim or
overwrite failed evidence. The coordinator owns completeness and publication review; workers supply the entries.

For a planned switch (for example a provider's usage limit), follow the
[coordinator-handoff skill](../../.claude/skills/coordinator-handoff/SKILL.md): it winds the workers down to
checkpoints, writes the private packet and ends with a takeover prompt. That prompt is a migration: it authorizes the
incoming coordinator to resume the named agenda at once, unlike the orientation-only starter below.

Before replacing the coordinator, leave the agenda checkpoint, PR/head refs, evidence, failures, active jobs,
remaining authority and exact next action. Confirm the old owner stopped before takeover. Preserve ongoing gates
and builds; a provider switch is not a reason to restart them. If every remaining item requires a missing decision
or capability, report that specific blocker and stop dispatch instead of manufacturing more work.

## Fresh-session starter

Paste this from the repository root. It onboards the coordinator without authorizing execution:

> Act as Souls development coordinator on a top frontier model. Read AGENTS.md, the private local bootstrap if
> present, docs/process/development-coordinator.md, coordinator-memory.md in that directory and the owner playbook.
> This first turn is orientation-only. Recover the private manifest/current state and inspect existing issue/PR,
> worker, job, CI and release status using read-only queries. Explain the project's purpose and operating rules,
> where development/release work currently stands, what is running or waiting, and what is uncertain or needs me.
> Use existing summaries and targeted checks, not an exhaustive audit. Distinguish observed facts from old reports.
> Do not launch or resume workers/goals, take over ownership, modify code or tickets, merge, deploy, or interfere
> with existing activity. An old agenda is context, not permission to act. Give me a compact orientation report,
> then stop and wait for me to set the initial agenda, capacity and instruction to begin.

After Gene authorizes execution, record the agreed agenda and capacity, reconcile ownership and follow the dispatch
loop above. An explicit migration request to resume a particular agenda may authorize this directly; the starter
prompt itself does not.
